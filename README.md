[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/findatapy)](https://pepy.tech/project/findatapy)

findatapy creates an easy to use Python API to download market data from many sources including ALFRED/FRED, Bloomberg, Yahoo, Google etc. using
a unified high level interface. Users can also define their own custom tickers, using configuration files. There is also functionality which
is particularly useful for those downloading FX market data. Below example shows how to download AUDJPY data from Quandl (and automatically 
calculates this via USD crosses).

*Contributors for the project are very much welcome, see below!*

```
from findatapy.market import Market, MarketDataRequest, MarketDataGenerator

market = Market(market_data_generator=MarketDataGenerator())

# Get you FRED API key from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html
fred_api_key = "WRITE YOUR KEY HERE" 

md_request = MarketDataRequest(start_date='year', category='fx', data_source='alfred', tickers=['AUDJPY'],
                               fred_api_key=fred_api_key)

df = market.fetch_market(md_request)
print(df.tail(n=10))
```

Here we see how to download tick data from DukasCopy, wih the same API calls and minimal changes in the code.

```
md_request = MarketDataRequest(start_date='14 Jun 2016', finish_date='15 Jun 2016',
                                   category='fx', fields=['bid', 'ask'], freq='tick', 
                                   data_source='dukascopy', tickers=['EURUSD'])

df = market.fetch_market(md_request)
print(df.tail(n=10))
```

I had previously written the open source PyThalesians financial library. This new findatapy library has similar functionality to the 
market data part of that library. However, I've totally rewritten the API to make it much cleaner and easier to use. It is also now a fully
standalone package, so you can more easily use it with whatever libraries you have for analysing market data or doing your backtesting (although I'd recommend
my own finmarketpy package if you are doing backtesting of trading strategies!).

A few things to note:
* Please bear in mind at present findatapy is currently a highly experimental alpha project and isn't yet fully 
documented
* Uses Apache 2.0 licence

# Contributors

Contributors are always welcome for finmarketpy, findatapy and chartpy. If you'd like to contribute, have a look at
[Planned Features](PLANNED_FEATURES.md) for areas we're looking for help on. Or if you have any ideas for improvements
to the libriares please let us know too!

# Requirements

Major requirements
* Required: Python 3.8 (Python 2 is not supported)
* Required: pandas, numpy etc.
* Recommended: blpapi - Bloomberg Python Open API
* Recommended: chartpy - for funky interactive plots ([https://github.com/cuemacro/chartpy](https://github.com/cuemacro/chartpy)) and
* Recommended: arctic - AHL library for managing time series in MongoDB

# Installation

For detailed installation instructions for chartpy, findatapy & finmarketpy and its associated Python libraries go to
[https://github.com/cuemacro/finmarketpy/blob/master/INSTALL.md](https://github.com/cuemacro/finmarketpy/blob/master/INSTALL.md). The tutorial includes details on how to setup your entire Python environment.

You can install the library using the below. After installation:
* Make sure you edit the dataconstants class for the correct Eikon API, Quandl API and Twitter API keys etc.
* Or you can run set_api_keys.py script to set the API keys via storing in your keyring
* Or you can create a datacred.py file which overwrites these keys
* Or some of these API keys can be passed via MarketDataRequest on demand

To install via pip (latest release):
```
pip install findatapy
```

To install newest repo copy:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/cuemacro/findatapy.git
```

# Couldn't push MarketDataRequest message

You might often get an error like the below, when you are downloading market data with
findatapy, and you don't have Redis installed.

```
Couldn't push MarketDataRequest
```

findatapy includes an in-memory caching mechanism, which uses Redis
a key/value in-memory store. The idea is that if we do exactly the same data download
call with the same parameters of a MarketDataRequest it will check this volatile cache
first, before going out to our external data provider (eg. Quandl).

Note, that Redis is usually set up as volatile cache, so once your computer is turned off, this cache
will be lost.

If Redis is not installed, this caching will fail and you'll
get this error. However, all other functionality aside from the caching will be fine. All
findatapy will do is to always go externally to download market data. Redis is available for Linux.
There is also an unsupported (older) Windows version available, which I've found works fine, 
although it lacks some functionality of later Redis versions.

# findatapy examples

In findatapy/examples you will find several demos on how to download data from many different sources. Note, 
for some such as Bloomberg or Eikon, you'll need to have a licence/subscription for it to work. Also there might be 
certain limits of the history you can download for intraday data from certain sources (you will need to check with
individual data providers)

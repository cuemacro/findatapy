# [findatapy](https://github.com/cuemacro/findatapy)

findatapy creates an easy to use Python API to download market data from many sources including Quandl, Bloomberg, Yahoo, Google etc. using
a unified high level interface. Users can also define their own custom tickers, using configuraiton files. There is also functionality which
is particularly useful for those downloading FX market data. Below example shows how to download AUDJPY data from Quandl (and automatically 
calculates this via USD crosses).

*Contributors for the project are very much welcome, see below!*

```
from findatapy.market import Market, MarketDataRequest, MarketDataGenerator

market = Market(market_data_generator=MarketDataGenerator())

md_request = MarketDataRequest(start_date='year', category='fx', data_source='quandl', tickers=['AUDJPY'])

df = market.fetch_market(md_request)
print(df.tail(n=10))
```

Here we see how to download tick data from DukasCopy, wih the same API calls and minimal changes in the code.

```
md_request = MarketDataRequest(start_date='14 Jun 2016', finish_date='15 Jun 2016',
                                   category='fx', fields=['bid', 'ask'], freq='tick', 
                                   data_source='dukascopy', tickers=['EURUSD'])

df = market.fetch_market(md_request)
print(df.tail(n=10))
```

I had previously written the open source PyThalesians financial library. This new findatapy library has similar functionality to the 
market data part of that library. However, I've totally rewritten the API to make it much cleaner and easier to use. It is also now a fully
standalone package, so you can more easily use it with whatever libraries you have for analysing market data or doing your backtesting (although I'd recommend
my own finmarketpy package if you are doing backtesting of trading strategies!).

A few things to note:
* Please bear in mind at present findatapy is currently a highly experimental alpha project and isn't yet fully 
documented
* Uses Apache 2.0 licence

# Requirements

Major requirements
* Required: Python 3.4, 3.5
* Required: pandas, numpy etc.
* Recommended: blpapi - Bloomberg Python Open API
* Recommended: chartpy - for funky interactive plots ([https://github.com/cuemacro/chartpy](https://github.com/cuemacro/chartpy)) and
* Recommended: arctic - AHL library for managing time series in MongoDB
* Recommended: multiprocessor_on_dill - standard multiprocessing library pickle causes issues ([https://github.com/sixty-north/multiprocessing_on_dill](https://github.com/sixty-north/multiprocessing_on_dill))
* Recommended: fredapi - ALFRED/FRED has been rewritten and added to the project directly (from https://github.com/mortada/fredapi)

# Installation

For detailed installation instructions for chartpy, findatapy & finmarketpy and its associated Python libraries go to
[https://github.com/cuemacro/finmarketpy/blob/master/INSTALL.md](https://github.com/cuemacro/finmarketpy/blob/master/INSTALL.md). The tutorial includes details on how to setup your entire Python environment.

You can install the library using the below. After installation:
* Make sure you edit the DataConstants class for the correct Quandl API and Twitter API keys etc

```
pip install git+https://github.com/cuemacro/findatapy.git
```
